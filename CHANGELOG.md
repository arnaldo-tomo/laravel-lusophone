# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-lusophone` will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-23

### üåü **BREAKTHROUGH: Universal Translation System**

#### **üîÑ AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION OF ALL TEXT**
- **REVOLUTIONARY**: Now automatically translates **EVERY** `__()` call in your application
- **100+ Common Phrases**: Authentication, navigation, forms, confirmations, status messages
- **ZERO CONFIGURATION**: Install and `{{ __('Forgot your password?') }}` becomes `"Esqueceu a senha?"` automatically
- **Smart Interception**: Hooks into Laravel's translation system seamlessly

#### **üì¶ AUTO-PUBLISH SYSTEM**
- **INSTANT SETUP**: Automatically publishes language files on first installation
- **NO MANUAL STEPS**: No need to run `php artisan vendor:publish` manually
- **WORKS IMMEDIATELY**: Install with `composer require` and everything works instantly

#### **üéØ COMPLETE BREEZE/JETSTREAM COVERAGE**
- **Forgot your password?** ‚Üí **Esqueceu a senha?** (MZ) / **Esqueceu a palavra-passe?** (PT)
- **You're logged in!** ‚Üí **Est√° conectado!** (MZ) / **Est√° ligado!** (PT)  
- **Profile Information** ‚Üí **Informa√ß√£o do Perfil** (MZ) / **Informa√ß√µes do Perfil** (PT)
- **Two Factor Authentication** ‚Üí **Autentica√ß√£o de Dois Fatores** (MZ/BR) / **Autentica√ß√£o de Dois Factores** (PT)

#### **üåç ENHANCED REGIONAL ADAPTATION**
- **Mozambique-First**: Local development defaults to MZ automatically
- **Online Auto-Detection**: Production auto-detects user's country via IP/headers  
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: PT uses "Palavra-passe", MZ/BR use "Senha"
- **Terminological Accuracy**: PT "Telem√≥vel" vs MZ/BR "Celular"

### Added
- `TranslationInterceptor` class with 100+ automatic translations
- Auto-publish system for zero-configuration installation
- Universal translation hooks in `LaravelLusophoneServiceProvider`
- Comprehensive Breeze/Jetstream phrase coverage
- Fuzzy matching for phrase variations and synonyms

- **Installation Process**: Now truly zero-configuration
- **Translation Coverage**: From validation-only to universal application text
- **Regional Detection**: Better local vs online environment detection
- **Performance**: Optimized translation interception with caching
- **Developer Experience**: Install and immediately see Portuguese interface

### Fixed
- Manual publish requirement eliminated
- Missing translations for common UI elements
- Inconsistent terminology across regions
- Complex setup process simplified
- Better caching mechanism for translations

### BREAKING CHANGES
